# ICPC Problems — Competitive Programming Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of ICPC-style algorithmic problems.  
I use this space to organize my training for competitive programming, track my progress, and document solutions in C++ with explanations for selected problems.

## Structure
Each folder may include:

- **`.cpp` files** — C++ solutions  
- **`.md` notes** — Problem explanations, approaches, and observations  
- **Example inputs/outputs** for testing  
- **Topic-based organization** for easier reference  

## Topics Covered
- Number Theory  
- Prefix Sums  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Graph Theory (BFS/DFS)  
- Greedy  
- Geometry Basics  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Constructive Algorithms

## Goals of This Repository
- Serve as my personal archive of ICPC training  
- Track all the problems I’ve solved and the techniques learned  
- Build a reference for revisiting concepts quickly  
- Improve speed, accuracy, and pattern recognition for contests  

## How to Run Solutions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catherinegonzal/ICPCProblems.git
```

Compile any solution:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -o run
./run
```

## Status
This repository is actively updated as I continue solving problems and organizing them by topic and difficulty.
