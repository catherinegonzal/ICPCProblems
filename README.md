## ICPC Problems Repository
This repository contains my personal collection of ICPC-style programming problems, categorized by topic and including both C++ solutions and notes/explanations for selected problems.
The goal of this repository is to help me organize my competitive programming preparation and track the problems I’ve solved.

## Contents
Each folder may include:
* .cpp files — My C++ solutions
* .md files — Notes, explanations, or problem breakdowns
* Example inputs / outputs

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
* My personal archive of ICPC training problems
* A way to track my progress and organize solved problems
* A reference for revisiting concepts like prefix sums, math techniques, geometry formulas, and more

## How to Use
You can clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/catherinegonzal/ICPCProblems.git
Compile any solution:

g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -o run
./run

## Status
This repository is actively updated as I continue solving problems and organizing them into topics.
