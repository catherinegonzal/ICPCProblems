## ICPC Training Problems
This repository contains my personal training solutions for ICPC-style programming problems, focused on improving my algorithmic thinking, speed, and implementation skills. These exercises support my preparation for competitive programming and complement my Computer Science coursework at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

## What’s inside
* Solutions in Python and C++
* Problems organized by topic:
    * Dynamic Programming
    * Graphs (BFS/DFS, shortest paths, trees)
    * Greedy Algorithms
    * Simulation
    * Math & Number Theory
* Clean, commented code aimed at clarity and correctness

## Goals of this repository
* Develop strong foundations in data structures and algorithms
* Practice solving problems under time constraints
* Improve implementation skills for competitions such as ICPC
* Build a visible track record of growth in algorithmic problem-solving
